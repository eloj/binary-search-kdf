# Overview

Experimenting with LUT'ed binary search in C++

This connects to my work on [radix sorting](https://github.com/eloj/radix-sorting) in that sorting is a requirement,
of course, and it also shares the concept of key-derivation to impose a total order of the input keys in 'unsigned space',
which is what enables the bit-tricks.
